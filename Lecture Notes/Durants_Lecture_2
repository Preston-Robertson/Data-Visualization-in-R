# Some wording stuff:

*emphasize* words
**bold** words

* Itemized
* List


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tmp = tribble(
  ~Fruit, ~Sweetness,
  'Oranges', 7,
  'Bananas', 5,
  'Pears',   10
)

ggplot(data=tmp)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(Fruit,Sweetness),stat = 'identity')
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(cut,..count..))

ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(cut,..prop.., group = 1))


```
group=1 makes it where each group is a vector with # of entries..?
group = 1 makes it so that it can be proportional so it is all grouped to one setting...


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(cut,..count..,fill = color, group = color), color = 'black')
```


# Summarizing Distributions
Use a Summary as one method:
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  stat_summary(mapping=aes(cut,depth),
               fun.min = min, fun.max = max, fun = median)
```
Box Plots:
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  stat_boxplot(mapping = aes(cut,depth), position = 'dodge')

# geom_boxplot = SAME

```
Violin Plot
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(cut,depth))
#stat_ydensity

```
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(cut,fill = clarity), position = 'dodge')
# Position is used to change the visualization of the filling in of the counts
# fill = sets the percentage within each bar, proportional
# dodge is the best, lets you see the bars beside each other
# jitter.... yeah, its not great 

```
Jitter positoning...
Small scales = Less accurate, so be careful
Larger Scales = More Accurate, we can see the high desnities
Randomness can be helpful and hurtful!
BE. CAREFUL. 




# Lecture 3
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg, mapping=aes(class,hwy))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()
 
```

```{r}
# Cartesian Coords
state = as_tibble(map_data('state'))

ggplot(state,aes(long,lat,group=group))+
  geom_polygon(fill='white',colour = 'black')+
  coord_quickmap() # Fixes map for distortions

```

```{r}
#Polar Coords

bar1 = ggplot(diamonds)+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(cut,fill=cut), show.legend = FALSE, width = 1)+
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)+
  labs(x=NULL,y=NULL)

bar1

bar1 + coord_flip()

# Now we gonna plot in Polar Coords
bar1 + coord_polar()
# Could be a really cool chart for something. dunno what, but something...


```
